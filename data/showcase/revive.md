## 🔧 **How Revive Works**

1️⃣ **IoT Monitoring with Raspberry Pi:**  
Raspberry Pi devices track waste bin status — monitoring volume, weight, and material condition — providing real-time data to improve waste management processes.

2️⃣ **AI Image Processing for Waste Classification:**  
The system uses computer vision to identify textile types (e.g., cotton, polyester) for faster, more accurate sorting. The AI model was trained on diverse textile datasets to ensure performance, even with wrinkled or damaged fabrics.

3️⃣ **Mobile App (React Native):**  
The user-friendly mobile app gives recyclers, fashion brands, and waste management businesses instant access to:

- Waste type and quantity data
- Recycling progress tracking
- Sustainability impact reports
